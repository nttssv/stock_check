* **Market Downturn:** The general stock market downturn, as indicated by the decline in the Dow, has likely contributed to the negative sentiment surrounding Coinbase.
* **Profit Taking:** Investors taking profits after a previous run-up in Coinbase stock has also contributed to the negative price movement.
* **Regulatory Concerns:** The mention of a banned Coinbase ad portraying a dystopian Britain suggests potential regulatory scrutiny or concerns about the company's image and operations.

* **Embedded Wallet Development:** Coinbase's development of embedded wallets for developers is a positive step towards simplifying Web3 onboarding and expanding its reach.
